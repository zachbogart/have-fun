Managing work for the [@have-fun Observable Team](https://observablehq.com/@have-fun?tab=profile) (a public exploration of Observable). Using this repo for:

- **Tracking progress**: Setting up [issues](https://github.com/zachbogart/have-fun/issues) for work on Observable, personal ideas and things to try
- **Data Imports**: Any data wrangling and data storage needed can be included here and read into notebooks. Serving as a place to do (1) more complex wrangling if necessary in stuff like R/Python and (2) accessible data storage, publically available for easy ingestion into Obeservable.

## Approach

- Get down ideas and talk them out here on GitHub as issues
- Work out ideas and show the results over on Observable
- Have fun!
